## 🔍 How Ethoscan Verification Works

EthosiFi doesn’t guess trust. It **proves it**—using only public, on-chain data.

Our verifier checks four behavioral pillars:
1. **Team Transparency**  
2. **Fair Launch Pledge**  
3. **Liquidity Commitment**  
4. **Treasury Transparency**

✅ **No KYC. No resumes. No whitepapers.**  
✅ **No gatekeeping. No favoritism.**  
✅ **Anyone can qualify—if they prove integrity on-chain.**

## 🛡️ How to Pass Ethoscan Verification

### 1. Treasury Transparency (150 pts)
- Use a **Gnosis Safe** (or compatible multi-sig)
- Include **≥3 identifiable signers**
- Ensure ≥2–3 signers have **public ENS names** (e.g., `lead.yourproject.eth`) or **SIWE-linked identities**

> ❌ Fails if: single-key wallet, anonymous multisig, or <3 signers

### 2. Team Transparency (100 pts)
- Link ≥2 core team members to the project via:
  - **ENS records** (e.g., `team.yourproject.eth`)
  - **SIWE signatures** (Sign-In with Ethereum)
  - **Public DNS-verified website** listing team addresses

> ❌ Fails if: all team wallets are anonymous or unlinked

### 3. Liquidity Commitment (150 pts)
- Lock LP tokens for **≥180 days**
- Use a **non-renounceable lock contract** (e.g., Team Finance, Unicrypt)
- Avoid temporary or fake locks

### 4. Fair Launch Pledge (100 pts)
- Sign an on-chain message pledging:
  - No private sale
  - Max wallet limits
  - Transparent token distribution
