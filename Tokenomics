# $ETHOS Tokenomics

**Total Supply**: 100,000,000 $ETHOS (fixed – no inflation)

**Purpose**  
$ETHOS powers the EthosiFi protocol. Every verification burns tokens permanently, creating scarcity as adoption and trust grow. The token aligns incentives between builders, users, and the ecosystem.

**Allocation Breakdown**

| Allocation                | Percentage | Amount         | Unlock / Vesting Details                                      | Purpose |
|---------------------------|------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Verification Rewards Pool | 40%        | 40,000,000     | Non-transferable credits distributed to early adopters<br>100 $ETHOS burned per verification redemption | Direct deflation tied to real usage |
| Protocol Treasury         | 20%        | 20,000,000     | Controlled by Gnosis Safe multi-sig<br>Milestone & DAO governed (post-mainnet) | Development, audits, security, grants, X1 partnerships |
| Core Team                 | 20%        | 20,000,000     | 10% (10,000,000) unlocked at TGE<br>10% (10,000,000) vested linearly over 36 months with 6-month cliff | Immediate runway + long-term alignment |
| Ecosystem Growth          | 10%        | 10,000,000     | Released via grants, incentives, builder rewards, partnerships | Accelerates adoption & network effects |
| Early Contributor Round   | 5%         | 5,000,000      | Fully unlocked at TGE<br>Sold at fixed price to early supporters (capped round) | Rewards early belief, replaces part of public allocation |
| Public Launch             | 5%         | 5,000,000      | Fully unlocked at TGE<br>Transparent distribution (no pre-sales, no insider advantage) | Open access for community at launch |

**Core Economic Mechanism**  
- Builders pay 100 $ETHOS to verify → 100% of fee is **permanently burned**  
- 10,000 verifications = 1,000,000 $ETHOS destroyed (1% of total supply)  
- 400,000 verifications = full 40% pool burned (40% supply reduction)  
- Scarcity scales directly with real protocol usage and ecosystem trust

**Vesting Details**  
- No vesting on public launch, early contributor round, or verification pool  
- Treasury unlocks are milestone-based and multi-sig controlled  
- Team vesting uses standard linear vesting contract with 6-month cliff followed by monthly unlocks over 36 months

**Why this structure is aligned & sustainable**  
- 40% of supply is deflationary by design  
- Team has meaningful skin in the game but long-term lockup  
- No pre-mined VC/insider dumps  
- Ecosystem & public portions ensure broad distribution  
- Burn flywheel creates value accrual as trust grows

EthosiFi is built to make ethical behavior profitable and scams the expensive outlier
